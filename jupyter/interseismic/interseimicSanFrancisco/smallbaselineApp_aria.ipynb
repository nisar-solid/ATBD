The Miami Insar Timeseries software in PYthon (MintPy), an open-source package for InSAR time-series analysis, is compatible with the outputs from the ARIA-tools package, and in combination with the ARIA-tools pre-processor can be used to estimate ground displacement time-series. \n",

In the example below, we will demonstrate a time-series derived from ARIA standard InSAR products over the San Francisco revealing interseimic fault motion, and with a first order visual comparison to local GNSS stations. \n",
