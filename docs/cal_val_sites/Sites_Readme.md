## Calibration and Validation for NISAR Solid Earth Science requirements

This directory contains information about the Calibration and Validation (CalVal) sites that the NISAR Science Team is planning to use for calibrating NISAR products and validating whether NISAR data products meet the NISAR Solid Earth science requirements.

The KMZ file here has the polygons outlining the CalVal site areas. The Excel workbook has a spreadsheet with additional information about the sites.
